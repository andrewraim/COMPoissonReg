*** Notes ***
o Thomas directly coded Rd files, so I will do that too. (No Roxygen2)
o I tried to make the ZICMP interface conform to CMP's interface
o For Thomas' computational code, try to keep changes to the minimum
  until we've talked

*** Questions ***
o Thomas does not support regression on nu, should we add support?
o Should we attempt to change the handling of the intercept for CMP?
  For example, I don't think a no-intercept model is possible now.
o We could consider programming some of these functions in Rcpp. Especially
  the function Z(lambda, nu), and maybe just the whole likelihood. But this
  would make the package harder to maintain...
o Should we attempt to unify the CMP functions with ZICMP? For example, the
  FIM functions for ZICMP might be usable for CMP.
o Do we want to support an optional regression on nu for CMP?
o Should we merge chisq and pval into a single "equidispersion.test" function?
o Does leverage function make sense for ZICMP?

*** Done ***
o Combined the two versions of compute-z functions
o Added ZICMP functions
o Added print functions to nicely print CMP and ZICMP results
o Added quantile residuals for both CMP and ZICMP
o For ZICMP, if any of the formulas are intercept-only, show estimates for
  non-regression parameters.
