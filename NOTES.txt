First things
o Thomas directly coded Rd files, so I will do that too
o Try to make ZICMP conform to cmp.R on the interface
o For Thomas' computational code, try to keep changes to the abs minimum 

compute-z functions
o (DONE) We both have versions of these. We only need one version.
o (DONE) Mine might be more general because they don't need to know about X
o We could consider programming some of these functions in Rcpp.
  Especially the function Z(lambda, nu), and maybe just the whole likelihood.

Interface for ZICMP fitting function
o We could add an optional ZI model term with "|" or with a 2nd formula.
o Should we update Thomas' original function, or start a new one for ZI?

FIM functions
o Consolidate Thomas' CMP FIM functions into one file
o Add my file for ZICMP FIM functions

RQRES
o Add my file for ZICMP, and write a function for CMP as well.
o Make it easier to call, maybe just pass in the fit object.
o Maybe they could be piggybacked into the S3 residuals function

Displaying results
o Add proper print and summary functions for CMP fitting
o Also include for ZICMP

Test for Equidispersion
o Might want to change from the S3 functions to "equi.test"
o Could return both p-value and test statistic from same function
o Or we could just put ZICMP into this same framework
