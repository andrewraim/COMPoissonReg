compute-z functions
o We both have versions of these. We only need one version.
o Mine might be more general because they don't need to know about X
o We could consider programming some of these functions in Rcpp.
  Especially the function Z(lambda, nu), and maybe just the whole likelihood.
o If we use Thomas', maybe consolidate them into one file

Interface for ZICMP fitting function
o We could add an optional ZI model term with "|" or with a 2nd formula.
o Should we update Thomas' original function, or start a new one for ZI?

FIM functions
o Consolidate Thomas' CMP FIM functions into one file
o Add my file for ZICMP FIM functions

RQRES
o Add my file for ZICMP, and write a function for CMP as well.
o Make it easier to call, maybe just pass in the fit object.
